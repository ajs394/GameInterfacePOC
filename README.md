# GameInterfacePOC
Quick MMO project with Griff

Run the __init__.py script in base dir (vscode ctrl+shift+b, or debug with f5)
 - Move with arrow keys, spawn enemies with enter and move with WASD.  
 - Abilities will be used with the number keys, shift+number will level up
 - Tab will attempt to target nearest enemy, will not target out of range
